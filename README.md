# Hi, I'm Adarsh ðŸ‘‹

I'm an MSc Data Science student exploring the frontiers of Machine Learning, with a special focus on healthcare, multimodal systems, and large language models.

ðŸš€ I build things like:
- Vision-Language Models for medical imaging
- LLMs trained on personal data to mimic user behavior
- Transformer models (like LLaMA) from scratch for educational deep dives
